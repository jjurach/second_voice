# Aider - Complete Guide

This guide covers how to use **Aider** (collaborative AI coding tool) with this project's AGENTS.md workflow.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Aider
pip install aider-chat

# Start Aider in your project
cd /path/to/second_voice
aider

# Example: Ask Aider to fix tests
> fix the pytest warnings

# Example: Ask for a feature
> add user authentication

# Exit Aider
> /exit
```

## How Aider Differs from Claude Code

| Feature | Claude Code | Aider |
|---------|---|---|
| **Approval Gates** | ✅ Built-in (ExitPlanMode) | ❌ None (changes apply immediately) |
| **Task Tracking** | ✅ TaskCreate/TaskUpdate | ❌ None (manual tracking) |
| **Git Integration** | Manual (Bash) | ✅ Automatic (auto-commits) |
| **Code Awareness** | Good | ✅ Excellent (understands diffs) |
| **File Editing** | Via Edit tool | ✅ Direct (shows diffs) |
| **Configuration** | CLAUDE.md | `.aider.conf.yml` |
| **Web Search** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Depends on model |

**Key Difference:** Aider changes code **immediately** without approval gates. This is fundamentally different from Claude Code.

## Aider Philosophy

Aider uses **trust-based collaboration**:
- You provide direction
- Aider makes changes and shows diffs
- You review changes in git
- You can undo with `git undo` if needed

This means AGENTS.md needs adaptation for Aider.

## AGENTS.md Workflow - Aider Adaptation

### Step A: Analyze & Declare Intent ✅ Same
Aider analyzes your request and determines scope.

**Aider does this conversationally:**
```
You: "Add caching to API responses"
Aider: "I'll create a cache module, integrate with API routes,
        and add tests. Should I proceed?"
```

### Step B: Create Spec File ✅ Same
Create spec file in `dev_notes/specs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_*.md`

**How to do it in Aider:**
```
You: "Create a spec file in dev_notes/specs/ for this feature.
     Include requirements, acceptance criteria, and test plan."

Aider: Creates the spec file directly
      (Shows the content it's creating)
```

### Step C: Create Project Plan ✅ Same
Create plan file in `dev_notes/project_plans/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_*.md`

**How to do it in Aider:**
```
You: "Create a project plan in dev_notes/project_plans/ with
     step-by-step implementation approach."

Aider: Creates the plan file
      (Shows proposed approach)
```

### Step D: AWAIT APPROVAL ⚠️ DIFFERENT
**Aider doesn't have built-in approval gates.**

**Instead, use conversational approval:**

```
You: "Here's the plan I want you to follow:
     1. Create cache module
     2. Integrate with API
     3. Add tests

     Should I proceed?"

Aider: "Yes, I'll implement this."
```

**Important differences:**
- ❌ No ExitPlanMode() (doesn't exist in Aider)
- ✅ Ask directly: "Should I proceed?"
- ✅ Aider will clarify if unsure
- ✅ You maintain control by asking before each step

### Step E: Implement & Document ✅ Same
Execute steps, create change docs, commit

**Aider does:**
```
1. Make changes (shown as diffs)
2. You can approve (press Enter) or ask for changes
3. Changes are applied to files
4. Aider can create change documentation
5. Git auto-commits changes
```

## Key Aider Features

### Automatic Git Management
**Aider auto-commits after changes:**
```
You: "Add authentication"
Aider: Makes changes
       Shows diffs
       Auto-commits with generated message
```

You can see commits:
```bash
git log --oneline  # See auto-generated commits
git diff HEAD~3    # See what Aider changed
```

### Code-Aware Editing
**Aider understands code structure:**
```
You: "In the User model, add an is_active field"
Aider: Finds the User model
       Understands the class structure
       Adds the field in the right place
       Shows diff for approval
```

### Diff Preview
**Before applying changes, see the diff:**
```
Aider shows:
  src/models/user.py
  + is_active = BooleanField(default=True)

You can: Accept (Enter) or Ask for changes
```

### Conversation History
**Aider remembers context:**
```
You: "Add user authentication"
     [Aider implements]

You: "Now add password reset functionality"
     [Aider knows the context from auth work]
```

### Shell Access
**Run commands directly:**
```
You: "Run the tests"
Aider: Executes pytest
       Shows output

You: "Tests are failing in test_cache.py"
Aider: Can view that file and fix it
```

## AGENTS.md Adaptation for Aider

Since Aider doesn't have approval gates, **adapt like this:**

### For Trivial Changes
```
Aider doesn't need approval for typos, simple fixes:
You: "Fix the typo in README line 42"
Aider: Fixes it
       Auto-commits
```

### For Features (With Approval)
```
You: "I want to add caching. Here's the plan:
     1. Create cache.py module
     2. Integrate with API routes
     3. Add tests

     Should I do this?"

Aider: "Yes, I'll implement step by step."
       [Makes changes, shows diffs]

You: Review diffs
     Say "OK" to accept
     Or "Let's change..." to modify
```

### For Experiments
```
You: "Try implementing the feature this way..."
Aider: Makes changes
       Shows diffs

You: "Actually, let's do it differently"
git undo  # Undo with git
You: "Here's the new approach..."
Aider: Tries the new way
```

## Configuration

### .aider.conf.yml
Create `.aider.conf.yml` in project root:

```yaml
# Aider Configuration
# Reference: https://aider.chat/docs/config/aider_conf.html

# Model settings
model: gpt-4o

# Git settings
auto-commits: true
attribute-author: true
attribute-committer: true

# Project Context
read:
  - AGENTS.md
  - docs/definition-of-done.md
  - docs/workflow-mapping.md

# Testing
auto-test: false
test-cmd: pytest
```

### Context Loading
By adding files to the `read` list in config, Aider automatically loads your project's core instructions on startup. This ensures it always knows about `AGENTS.md`.

## Using Aider with AGENTS.md

### Workflow for a Feature

```
1. You: Start Aider
   aider

2. You: Request feature with context
   "I want to add caching to the API.
    Caching should:
    - Cache GET requests only
    - Invalidate on POST/PUT/DELETE
    - Use in-memory cache
    - Have tests

    Should I proceed?"

3. Aider: Confirms understanding
   "Yes, I'll implement this step by step."

4. Step 1 - Create cache module:
   You: "Step 1: Create src/cache.py with the cache implementation"
   Aider: Creates file, shows content
   You: Review, say "OK" or ask for changes

5. Step 2 - Integrate with API:
   You: "Step 2: Update src/api.py to use the cache"
   Aider: Shows diff
   You: "The invalidation logic looks wrong, can you fix..."
   Aider: Fixes it, shows new diff
   You: "OK, apply this"

6. Step 3 - Add tests:
   You: "Step 3: Create comprehensive tests in tests/test_cache.py"
   Aider: Creates test file
   Aider: Can run tests
   You: Review test output, ask for more tests if needed

7. Documentation:
   You: "Create change documentation in dev_notes/changes/"
   Aider: Creates the documentation

8. Verify:
   You: "Run the full test suite"
   Aider: Runs pytest
   You: "Great! Let's commit this"
   Aider: (Already auto-committed, but shows summary)

9. You: Exit Aider
   /exit
```

## Aider Commands

```bash
# Inside Aider
/help           # Show all commands
/exit           # Exit Aider
/add file.py    # Add file to context
/remove file.py # Remove file from context
/git diff       # Show git diff
/git add        # Git add (before manual commit)
/git reset      # Git reset (undo changes)
/run command    # Run shell command
```

## Handling Approval without ExitPlanMode

Since Aider has no built-in approval, use **conversational approval**:

### Pattern: Clear Plan First
```
You: "Before I ask you to implement, let me show you the plan:

Step 1: Create cache.py with Cache class
Step 2: Add get(), set(), invalidate() methods
Step 3: Integrate with /api/users endpoint
Step 4: Add tests

Does this sound right?"

Aider: "Yes, this approach makes sense."

You: "Great, let's proceed. Step 1: Create cache.py"

Aider: Creates the file
```

### Pattern: Step-by-Step Confirmation
```
You: "Next step: Integrate cache with API routes.
     Should I proceed?"

Aider: "Yes, I'm ready"

You: "Update src/api.py to use the cache"
     [Aider shows diff]

You: "Looks good, apply these changes"
     [Aider applies and auto-commits]

You: "Next step: Create tests"
```

### Pattern: Undo and Retry
```
You: "Actually, I don't like this approach"
     git undo

Aider: Undoes the commit

You: "Let me try a different approach..."
     [New direction]

Aider: Implements the new approach
```

## When to Use Each Approval Pattern

| Situation | Pattern | Aider Response |
|-----------|---------|---|
| Simple fix (typo) | Just ask | Fixes directly |
| New feature | Show plan first | Confirms understanding |
| Complex change | Step-by-step | Confirms each step |
| Uncertain | Ask for advice | Gives suggestions |
| Mistake | Undo + retry | Implements new approach |

## Key Practices with Aider

### 1. Suggest, Don't Command
```
❌ "Add error handling"
✅ "Let's add error handling for network timeouts.
   Should I proceed?"
```

### 2. Review Changes as Diffs
```
Aider shows diff → You review → You say "OK" or "Change..."
Don't skip this step! Diffs are your approval mechanism.
```

### 3. Use Git Undo if Needed
```
You disagree with a change?
git undo
git log --oneline  # See what was undone
Aider continues from previous commit
```

### 4. Create Specs and Plans as Files
```
You: "Create a spec file for this feature in dev_notes/specs/"
     [Aider creates it]

You: "Now create a plan in dev_notes/project_plans/"
     [Aider creates it]

This maintains AGENTS.md compliance.
```

### 5. Document Changes Manually
```
You: "Create a change documentation in dev_notes/changes/
     describing what we just implemented"

Aider: Creates the documentation file
```

### 6. Use Conversation as Approval Log
```
Since Aider doesn't have approval gates,
the conversation history IS the approval log.

Helpful: Save conversation or take screenshots.
```

## Limitations Unique to Aider

### No Built-in Approval Gates
- Changes apply immediately
- You must review diffs before pressing Enter
- Conversation is your approval mechanism
- Difficult for large teams (no formal approval)

### No Task Tracking
- No TaskCreate/TaskUpdate
- Must track progress manually
- Create tracking in dev_notes/ if needed

### Git Auto-Commit Limitations
- Commit messages are auto-generated (may be generic)
- Hard to have meaningful commit history
- Can be good or bad depending on preference

### No MCP Server Support
- Cannot extend capabilities via MCP
- Limited to built-in functionality

### Model Dependent
- Capabilities depend on which model you use
- Web search depends on model capabilities
- Context window depends on model

## Tips for Success with Aider

### Tip 1: Be Conversational
```
Aider responds better to natural language:
✅ "Can you add validation to the login form?"
❌ "Add validation"
```

### Tip 2: Provide Context
```
✅ "The User model in src/models/user.py needs a new field
   for tracking login attempts. It should..."
❌ "Add login attempts field"
```

### Tip 3: Ask for Explanation
```
You: "Why did you choose this approach?"
Aider: Explains reasoning
You: "Makes sense" or "Actually, let's try..."
```

### Tip 4: Use Files for Large Instructions
```
You: "Read this design document in docs/feature-design.md
     and implement according to this spec"

Aider: Reads file, implements based on design
```

### Tip 5: Check Diffs Carefully
```
Before accepting changes:
- Review the diff
- Check indentation and style
- Verify logic
- Ask for changes if needed
```

## Connecting to AGENTS.md

Aider workflow should still follow AGENTS.md principles:

```
Step A: Analyze ✅ Aider does this
Step B: Spec file ✅ Aider creates (you request)
Step C: Plan file ✅ Aider creates (you request)
Step D: Approval ⚠️ Conversational instead of ExitPlanMode
Step E: Implement ✅ Aider does this step-by-step
```

**Documentation hierarchy:**
```
CLAUDE.md or README
  ↓
AGENTS.md (core workflow)
  ↓
workflow-mapping.md (how it maps to Aider)
  ↓
This document (Aider specifics)
  ↓
prompt-patterns.md (general request patterns)
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Add Tests
```
You: "Let's add comprehensive unit tests for src/auth.py

The tests should cover:
- Successful login
- Failed login with wrong password
- Missing required fields
- Valid token generation

Should I proceed?"

Aider: "Yes, I'll create comprehensive tests in tests/test_auth.py"

You: [Aider shows test file]
     "Looks good, apply these changes"

You: [Review test output]
     "Perfect, tests pass"
```

### Example 2: Quick Bug Fix
```
You: "There's a bug in src/config.py line 45 where
     the default value is wrong. It should be 'local'
     not 'remote'. Can you fix it?"

Aider: "I'll fix that"
       [Shows diff]

You: "Good, apply it"
```

### Example 3: Refactoring with Questions
```
You: "Can we refactor the AudioRecorder class for clarity?
     It's getting long and has too many responsibilities."

Aider: "I can break it into smaller classes. Here's my idea:
       - AudioRecorder (main interface)
       - AmplitudeCalculator (amplitude logic)
       - AudioFileManager (file I/O)

       Does this sound good?"

You: "Yes, let's try it"

Aider: [Implements refactoring]
       [Shows diffs]

You: "Review diffs"
     "Looks good, apply"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Aider made changes I don't want
**Solution:** `git undo` to revert, then ask Aider differently

**Problem:** Aider doesn't understand my request
**Solution:** Be more specific, provide examples, reference files

**Problem:** Changes look wrong in diff
**Solution:** Ask Aider to revise before accepting (before pressing Enter)

**Problem:** Forgot to request spec/plan file
**Solution:** Use `/run` to create it manually, then ask Aider to help

## Quick Reference

| Need | How to do it | Example |
|------|---|---|
| Create file | Ask directly | "Create src/cache.py with..." |
| Edit code | Describe change | "Add error handling to..." |
| See diff | Aider shows it | After each change, review |
| Run tests | Ask | "Run pytest" |
| Undo change | git undo | git undo |
| Create spec | Ask | "Create dev_notes/specs/..." |
| Create plan | Ask | "Create dev_notes/project_plans/..." |
| Get approval | Ask before step | "Should I proceed?" |
| Document | Ask | "Create change documentation in dev_notes/changes/" |
| Exit | Command | /exit |
